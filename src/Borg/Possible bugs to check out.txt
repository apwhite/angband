items that the borg will consume from trying to empty his inven but not fully implemented in the game (defence or attack routines):
  shrooms of second sight (ESP)
  shroom of stone skin, sprinting, terror, clear mind, 
  potion of dragon breath

^zo needs to be rewritten to match the flags.	

-Remove curse any cursed types

-Sell immediately instead of visiting all shops when scumming

-Mixed blessing items (new rings)
 - Ring of mouse might be good idea for a mage.
 - Reckless attack might be good for a warrior

	

List of bugs fixed

(#367) Prompt for which ring to replace when wearing two

(#762) Alchemist's Gloves are now wearable by mages
